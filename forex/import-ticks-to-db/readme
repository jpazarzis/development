*******************************************************************************

This directory contains the utilities to update a mysql database with the OANDA
provided tick data.

The requirement for this code to run is to have already created a mysql data
base called forex. All other details are implemented here, so we do not need to
create new tables or indexes.

update_all.sh
--------------

To update all the available ticks run the update_all.sh which will call the
reformat_ticks.py for each currency pair.

After update_all.sh will finish all the ticks will be inserted to the forex
database plus it will create hourly candlesticks based on this data.

Any ticks between FRIDAY 5:00 pm and SUNDAY 5:00 pm will be skipped since this
is the weekend period for OANA


The historical tick data are provided by oanda in a clear text format following
this format:

timestamp, bid, ask

DD/MM/YY HH:MM:SS, bid, ask

- We can have multiple records corresponding to the same timestamp (intra-second
ticks). 

- We have (some) ticks for weekends and holidays.

- The are few cases where ticks appear to have mixed timestamps.



- The data will be saved to a mysql table following the following format:

timestamp, sequence, bid, ask

(sequence represents the intra-second sequence the tick was received)

- mixed ticks will be skipped

- holidays and weekends will be skipped.

- Each currency pair will have its own table
