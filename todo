~ Created a Tick class removing the old one by adding a boost timestamp so now
we no longer hold year-month-day as separate data. I also changed the Order and

@@ Modify the Model and Order process tick to use the TickPool instead of been
called back by the TickEngine.

~ It seems to me that the genetic algorithm has a bug. As it creates
generations at some point it seems that is no longer selecting the chromosome

Status: Fixed.  The bug was caused by the rollback logic in the genetic
algorithm

@@ Add multi threading capabilities to the optimizer so it can run faster
