<h3>Comparing Parlays based on their length and selections</h3>
In this page we can check the behavior of several different systems based in
number of selections and parlay length.
<p/>
Assuming we have M selected events (for example football games where we think we
have an edge) we can create several different systems by changing the length of
the parlay. For example if we have six games, we can select to combine them by 5
playing all possible combinations consisting of 5 games. By checking the
corresponding table for 6 selections and length of parlay 5 we can verify that
we need to play 6 combinations (costing $1 each for a total of $6). 
<p/>
In this example, if we hit 5 out of the 6 games we will end up with just one
winning combo returning $5. If we hit all 6 though, we will win 6 combinations
for a total return of $32.

The following abbreviations are used:
<p/>
<b>M</b>: count of winning events
<p/>
<b>WC</b>: count of winning combinations
<p/>
<b>PNL</b>: Profit or loss based in 1 unit bets
