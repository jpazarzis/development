Data Types:

    Comparable: double

    Boolean

    integer : used for indexing 

    Vector: array of doubles

    The environment starts up with a concrete set of data.
    For example:

        Prices[] : array of the prices as double
        current_hour: double
        current_minute: double
        current_second: double
        minute_to_trade : double


Build in functions:
    length(V) : returns the length of a vector

    get_at(V,index): returns the element in the position index

Primitive Functions:

    F(v) : double

    v: should always be of type vector

    return value is always a double

    example:
        moving_average(V, c)

Comparison Operator:
    
    > < >= <= == !=

    Example:
        A > B -> BOOLEAN

Associative Operator:

    AND OR NOT

Expression:
    Comparable (Comparison Operator) Comparable 
================================================================

COMPARISON: [ > < >= <= == != ]
ASSOCIATION: [AND OR NOT]

BOOLEAN := COMPARISON EXPR1 EXPR2

expression ::= BOOLEAN
               BOOLEAN ASSOCIATION expression
